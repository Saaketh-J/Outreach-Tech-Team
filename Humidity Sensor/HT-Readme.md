The humidity/temperature sensor uses GP3

The sensor detects the temperature and humidity around it.

The primary usecase is placing this in a bathroom to determine when someone is taking a shower.

---

Set up: Position the sensor in a bathroom where the individual will take showers.

Insights:

- The humidity sensor will allow us to determine the humidity levels in the bathroom
- If the humidity is higher than the norm, it likely indicates that a shower is taking place. The frequency of this can be tracked to ensure the individual is showering every day.
- If the humidity stays high for a long period of time (>1 hour), it could indicate that the person has fallen in the shower or they left the tap running. Generally, the more humid it is, the more slippier things would be and falls more common.
