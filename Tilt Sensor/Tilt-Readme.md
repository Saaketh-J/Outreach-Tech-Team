The tilt sensor is using GP1.

The sensor detects when it has been tilted.

The primary usecase is determining when a door has been opened and closed.

---

Set up: Position the sensor on the corner of a door that you want to track the movements through.

Insights:

- The tilt sensor allows us to determine when a door has been opened
- Determine the amount of time it took to open or close the door
- Track the times of day the door is opened and alert if it's being done at odd hours
- If the door has been opened at some time and the person has not returned, could indicate something awry
- TODO: Figure out which way the door is being moved (open or close)
- TODO: Determine how hard the door was closed (speed it closed with)
