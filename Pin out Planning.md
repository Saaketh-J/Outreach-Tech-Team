This file will contain what pins we are using in our code in order to not use the same pin outs and in theory be able to run all our code simultaneously if needed

for the PIR sensor, I utilized pin 0 for my LED and pin 1 for the PIR sensor itself, and have the power for the sensor itself coming form the 3V
