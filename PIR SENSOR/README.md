This folder contains the code utilized in order to work and capture PIR sensor data.

Using GP0 to switch my LED ligth on and off. I then utilized GP1 to to connect to me OUT pin on the PIR sensor.

I also drew power from the 3V3 outlet on the breadboard kit. Ground was simply grounded on the breadboard kit as well.

The purpose of this sensor is to detect motion in a visual way without creating any security issues with the client. It works by detecting any change in the 

sensor from either side of the semisphere that houses the sensors.
