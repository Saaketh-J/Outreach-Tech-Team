This folder contains the code utilized in order to work and capture PIR sensor data.

Using GP0 to switch my LED ligth on and off. I then utilized GP1 to to connect to me OUT pin on the PIR sensor.

I also drew power from the 3V3 outlet on the breadboard kit. Ground was simply grounded on the breadboard kit as well.

Make sure that the jumper is set to the repeatable trigger set. This ensures that the sensor is able to capture a continuous stream of data to enable

recognition of what is to be considered a registered movement versus an accidental trigger.
