This is the readme.md file

we should use this file to let each other know what pins we are assigning in our code in order to ensure we are not using the 

same pins, therefore theoretically creating one working environment where everything could simulatneously run

I am not certain how we will go about organizing our code, so I just created a branch for my stuff just in case
