This branch of the Github will contain things Luis is working on.

Currently, the priority is to get set up on here and then from there to go ahead and start uploading code as I work on it.

The focus of my branch was the PIR sensor which was by far the most difficult to get started in that there is more to do

that is not covered in the book that is provided. In my code, I am playing around with the jumper as well as the code 

in order to try and create a program that will read more data

More data = more better
